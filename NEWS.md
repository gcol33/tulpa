## 2026-05-05 — multi-term + slope REs on the spec-Laplace path

* `tulpa_laplace_spec_dense` (and its public C ABI shim) now accepts the
  full multi-term, multi-coefficient RE structure populated by `populate_re`
  in downstream model packages: K = `data.n_re_terms` random-effect terms,
  each with `q_t = re_n_coefs[t]` coefficients per group (intercept-only
  when `q_t == 1`, intercept + slopes when `q_t > 1`), uncorrelated
  (`(x||g)`) or correlated (`(x|g)`) prior covariance. Per-process
  sharing is uniform across terms via `data.sharing.re`.
* The legacy single-term path (`layout.re_start` / `layout.re_end` /
  `log_sigma_re_idx` with `data.n_re_terms == 0`) is preserved and stays
  bit-identical numerically.
* The `result_out->mode` writeout from `tulpa_laplace_spec_dense_impl`
  now concatenates every RE term's block in term order
  (`re_start_multi[t]..re_end_multi[t]`), matching the new
  `SpecLatentLayout` ordering.
* New internal test fixture `cpp_laplace_spec_test_multi_re` exercises
  the multi-term path end-to-end against hand-derived linear-Gaussian
  reference solutions; new tests in `tests/testthat/test-laplace-spec.R`
  cover (a) two crossed intercept-only terms, (b) one correlated random
  slope, (c) one uncorrelated random slope.
* `TULPA_ABI_VERSION` bumped from 3 → 4. Downstream packages that ship
  with the spec-Laplace dispatcher (e.g. tulpaGlmm) must be rebuilt
  against the new headers.
